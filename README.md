# opnsense-go

---

This project is currently unmaintained, I do not have any time for it at the moment.
There is a lot of potential, but it would require a code generator to make code based
on the API docs.

If you would be interested in sponsoring the continuation of this project, please
reach out to me.

This might become a well covered OPNsense library covering the API in Go...

Currently the parts of the API thats needed for other projects are implemented:

- WireGuard
- BGP Neighbors
- Backup
- Package management
- Alias
